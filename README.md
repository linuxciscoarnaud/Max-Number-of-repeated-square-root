# Max-Number-of-repeated-square-root
Maximum number of repeated square root that can be performed using the numbers from the interval [A..B]

In this problem, it's asked to write a function solution that, given two integers
A and B, returns the maximum number of repeated square root operations that can be
performed using the numbers from the interval [A..B] (both ends included) as starting points.
Square root operations can be performed as long as the result is still an integer.
